 	<p> Hello, nice to meet you, my name is Teodora Margaritova. Welcome to my webpage that I created for my Informatics class in 12th grade. I am a senior at the American College of Sofia and my profile is Chemistry. In university, I intend to pursue Pharmacology as it is a subject that highly interests me. 
 		This year, I learned a lot about how to program in CSS and HTML in order to be able to ultimately make my own webpage. That is really exciting given the fact that I now have a new language through which I can communicate with others: web design.
